<h5>  <p>
  A single goat dramatically changed my life. My sister had discovered him on the side of the road. She brought him home and I have cherished him ever since. He is a major motivator in my life because he pushes me to strive. His name is Sonny because I consider him my son and I strive for him. He has all persuaded my career path. To take care of more animals like him. One day I would like to have a sanctuary for all times of animals and to foster many back to health.

 <h3 class="be"> College?</h3>
  <h5>There are hundreds of colleges nationwide, but I have deeply considered six colleges with Washington State being first. These colleges are very unique individually, but they all have one common interest.  My intended majors are revolved around animal science. I have wanted to be a veterinary or work in a field with animals my entire childhood. I have a close connection with animals from experience. I have first handling witnessed the atmosphere of animal medicine. It is a hectic job with some of the best people you'll ever interact with. While research each college and application process can be stressful  I try to really pay attention to the tiny details about each school. The classrooms, the professors and the dorms. Four of the schools i'm highly interested in our out of state. Which makes me nervous because to live far from home is a new chapter on its own.  Dorms will be a maybe factor when debating which college is best.
